#
# - Defined as macros in the Kernel module (Elixir's default environment), not language constructs
# - As previously mentioned, only `false` and `nil` are falsy values

# case
#
# - A switch statement with cases as pattern matching instances, where `_` is the default case
# - Supports guards with the use of `when`, more information about them can be found at https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/guards.html
#   â€¢ Chaining `when`s instead of `when condition or condition` can be useful, as failed guards

# cond
#
# - Used when needed to match conditions rather than values, similar to a `if` / `else if` structure in other languages
# - Unlike `case`, default condition for cond is `true`
#

# with
#
# - Useful when you might use a `case` statement or situations that cannot 'cleanly' be piped together
# - Composed of the keywords, the generators and an expression
# - The expressions are executed sequentially
# - If an expression fails to match, the non-matching value will be returned
